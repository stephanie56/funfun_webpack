- Where I learned it: [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKTDYSK0ArI&list=PLkEZWD8wbltnRp6nRR8kv97RbpcUdNawY&index=2)

## Keypoints:
- Without the help of webpack plugin, you need to create a HTML file in ./dist and inject the bundle.js there manually
- To solve this problem, you can get the help with this plugin: html-webpack-plugin
